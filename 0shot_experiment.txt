The circle turns yellow only when the square is blue. The triangle turns black only when the square is blue or the circle is yellow. The water turns black only when the triangle is black. The smoke turns black only when the circle is yellow.
Suppose we force the smoke to turn black, without forcing anything else. Is the water necessarily black?
  Proof 0: TODO
Expected answer: No
Predicted answer: No, the water is not necessarily black. The water turns black only when the triangle is black, and forcing the smoke to turn black does not necessarily mean that the triangle is black.

The circle turns blue only when the square is black. The star turns purple only when the square is black. The smoke turns green only when the star is purple. The water turns white only when the square is black or the star is purple.
Suppose the star is purple. Is the water necessarily white?
  Proof 0: The star is purple. The square is black. The water is white.  Proof 1: The star is purple. The water is white.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: No, the water is not necessarily white. The water will only turn white if the square is black or the star is purple.

The star turns purple only when the square is white. The triangle turns red only when the star is purple. The sand turns purple only when the triangle is red or the square is white. The circle turns orange only when the triangle is red or the square is white.
Suppose the star is purple. Is the circle necessarily orange?
  Proof 0: The star is purple. The square is white. The circle is orange.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: No, the circle is not necessarily orange. The circle turns orange only when the triangle is red or the square is white, and in this case neither of those conditions is met.

The smoke turns purple only when the stone is blue. The star turns white only when the stone is blue. The lightbulb turns red only when the smoke is purple. The square turns red only when the smoke is purple.
Suppose we force the stone to turn blue, without forcing anything else. Is the lightbulb necessarily red?
  Proof 0: The stone is blue. The smoke is purple. The lightbulb is red.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: No, the lightbulb is not necessarily red. It will only turn red if the smoke is also purple.

The water turns black only when the star is white. The circle turns orange only when the water is black or the star is white. The stone turns yellow only when the circle is orange. The smoke turns white only when the stone is yellow.
Suppose the star is white. Is the stone necessarily yellow?
  Proof 0: The star is white. The circle is orange. The stone is yellow.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: No, the stone is not necessarily yellow. The stone turns yellow only when the circle is orange, and the circle turns orange only when the water is black or the star is white. Since the star is white in this scenario, the water must be black for the circle to turn orange and the stone to turn yellow.

The smoke turns yellow only when the water is white. The sand turns purple only when the smoke is yellow. The lightbulb turns blue only when the water is white. The triangle turns yellow only when the smoke is yellow.
Suppose the triangle is yellow. Is the smoke necessarily yellow?
  Proof 0: The triangle is yellow. The smoke is yellow.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: Yes, the smoke is necessarily yellow if the triangle is yellow.

The lightbulb turns white only when the circle is red. The smoke turns yellow only when the lightbulb is white. The sand turns red only when the smoke is yellow. The water turns green only when the lightbulb is white.
Suppose we force the sand to turn red, without forcing anything else. Is the water necessarily green?
  Proof 0: TODO
Expected answer: No
Predicted answer: No, the water is not necessarily green. The water will only turn green when the lightbulb is white, and forcing the sand to turn red does not necessarily mean that the lightbulb is white.

The lightbulb turns black only when the circle is blue. The star turns orange only when the lightbulb is black. The square turns purple only when the circle is blue. The smoke turns yellow only when the lightbulb is black.
Suppose we force the smoke to turn yellow, without forcing anything else. Is the lightbulb necessarily black?
  Proof 0: TODO
Expected answer: No
Predicted answer: Yes, the lightbulb would be black in this scenario since the smoke can only turn yellow when the lightbulb is black.

The triangle turns orange only when the lightbulb is orange. The smoke turns yellow only when the lightbulb is orange. The square turns black only when the smoke is yellow or the lightbulb is orange. The star turns red only when the smoke is yellow.
Suppose the lightbulb is orange. Is the star necessarily red?
  Proof 0: The lightbulb is orange. The smoke is yellow. The star is red.
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: Yes, the star is necessarily red if the lightbulb is orange.

The stone turns black only when the water is white. The sand turns black only when the stone is black. The lightbulb turns yellow only when the sand is black or the water is white. The circle turns blue only when the stone is black or the lightbulb is yellow.
Suppose the circle is blue. Is the sand necessarily black?
  Proof 0: TODO
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer: No, the sand is not necessarily black. The circle can turn blue if the stone is black or the lightbulb is yellow.
