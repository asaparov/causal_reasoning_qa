Question: The circle turns blue only when the square is black. The star turns purple only when the square is black. The smoke turns green only when the star is purple. The water turns white only when the square is black or the star is purple.
Suppose the star is purple. Is the water necessarily white?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The star is purple.
2. The square must be black for the star to be purple.
3. The circle must be blue for the square to be black.
4. The smoke must be green for the star to be purple.

Therefore, the water must be white for the square to be black or the star to be purple. So, yes, the water is necessarily white.

Question: The stone turns red only when the square is yellow. The circle turns blue only when the square is yellow or the stone is red. The water turns yellow only when the square is yellow. The smoke turns green only when the circle is blue.
Suppose the circle is blue. Is the square necessarily yellow?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The circle is blue.
2. The circle turns blue only when the square is yellow or the stone is red.
3. The stone turns red only when the square is yellow.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the square is necessarily yellow.

Question: The water turns blue only when the smoke is yellow. The sand turns purple only when the smoke is yellow or the water is blue. The square turns yellow only when the water is blue. The star turns purple only when the water is blue.
Suppose the sand is purple. Is the water necessarily blue?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The water turns blue only when the smoke is yellow.
2. The sand turns purple only when the smoke is yellow or the water is blue.
3. We know that the sand is purple.

Therefore, the water must be blue in order for the sand to be purple.

Question: The square turns blue only when the star is green. The water turns black only when the square is blue or the star is green. The lightbulb turns purple only when the water is black or the square is blue. The triangle turns red only when the lightbulb is purple.
Suppose the triangle is red. Is the water necessarily black?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

If the triangle is red, then the lightbulb must be purple.
If the lightbulb is purple, then the water could be black or the square could be blue.
Therefore, the water is not necessarily black.

Question: The circle turns white only when the water is purple. The stone turns black only when the circle is white or the water is purple. The star turns blue only when the circle is white or the stone is black. The triangle turns yellow only when the star is blue or the water is purple.
Suppose the triangle is yellow. Is the star necessarily blue?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

The triangle is yellow, so the star must be either blue or not blue.

If the star is not blue, then the only way the triangle can be yellow is if the water is purple.

If the water is purple, then the circle must be white and the stone must be black.

Therefore, if the triangle is yellow, the star must be blue.

Question: The star turns black only when the lightbulb is blue. The square turns blue only when the lightbulb is blue or the star is black. The sand turns black only when the lightbulb is blue. The smoke turns yellow only when the star is black.
Suppose the smoke is yellow. Is the square necessarily blue?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The smoke is yellow, which means the star is black.
2. The square turns blue only when the lightbulb is blue or the star is black.
3. Since the star is black, the square could be either blue or not blue.

Therefore, the answer is no, the square is not necessarily blue.

Question: The lightbulb turns black only when the water is red. The star turns white only when the lightbulb is black or the water is red. The triangle turns purple only when the water is red. The circle turns orange only when the lightbulb is black.
Suppose the circle is orange. Is the star necessarily white?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The circle is orange, which means the lightbulb is black.
2. The star turns white only when the lightbulb is black or the water is red.

Therefore, yes, the star is necessarily white.

Question: The circle turns white only when the star is purple. The sand turns white only when the star is purple or the circle is white. The smoke turns green only when the sand is white. The triangle turns yellow only when the circle is white or the sand is white.
Suppose the sand is white. Is the star necessarily purple?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The sand is white.
2. The circle must be white for the sand to be white (from the first statement).
3. The star must be purple for the circle to be white (from the first statement).

Therefore, yes, the star is necessarily purple if the sand is white.

Question: The stone turns purple only when the water is purple. The smoke turns red only when the stone is purple or the water is purple. The circle turns white only when the water is purple. The star turns yellow only when the stone is purple.
Suppose the smoke is red. Is the stone necessarily purple?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The smoke turns red only when the stone is purple or the water is purple.
2. The smoke is red.

Therefore, the stone is necessarily purple.

Question: The stone turns yellow only when the sand is yellow. The square turns purple only when the sand is yellow or the stone is yellow. The smoke turns blue only when the stone is yellow. The star turns black only when the sand is yellow or the smoke is blue.
Suppose the smoke is blue. Is the star necessarily black?
Let's think step-by-step:
Expected answer: Yes
Predicted answer:

1. The smoke turns blue only when the stone is yellow.
2. We know that the smoke is blue.
3. Therefore, the stone must be yellow.
4. The star turns black only when the sand is yellow or the smoke is blue.
5. We know that the smoke is blue.

Therefore, the star is necessarily black.
